Catch The Odds is a falling object catcher type of game where you must catch the odd-sided polygons falling from above, where the game gradually gets faster and faster, while maintaining control of the player. I did this project solo, so I'm responsible for the game design, art, and the programming side, but I got my SFXs from outside sources.

Hopeless is a side-scrolling game that combines the mechanics of Cat Mario with the art style of Limbo. I use this game as a teaching material to introduce basic game programming concepts using Unity. The core game mechanics can be developed in less than one day.
