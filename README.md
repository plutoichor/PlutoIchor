## 🔴About
**ProjectStir [Pre-Alpha]** is a driving simulation application meticulously crafted to assess driving skills performance using a game-centric approach. Within this application, drivers or users are tasked with navigating a cityscape, all the while gathering vital checkpoints. The performance evaluation revolves around quantifying the number of **checkpoints** successfully acquired within specific time constraints. This performance assessment also encompasses a metric denoted as **damage**, which quantifies the extent of vehicular wear and tear sustained throughout the driving experience.

The game is set against an urban backdrop in Asia, replete with one-way streets capable of accommodating only one vehicle at any given moment. Enhanced user performance, characterized by a greater accumulation of checkpoints and minimal vehicle damage, leads to superior overall outcomes. Project-Stir can be operated using various input devices, including a keyboard, joystick, or steering wheel controller.

Within this gaming environment, an user data collection process is employed, employing a Leaderboard-based, game-oriented methodology. The feature for gathering performance data is initiated through data submission following a player's successful game completion. The variables collected encompass **Player Nickname**, **Checkpoint**, and **Damage** data. This performance data is seamlessly integrated with Looker Studio, a public-accessible data visualization tool. This data collection methodology is easily accessible for entertainment purposes or, if necessary, for research applications. Access to this data is available via https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/b00ab0ae-0caf-4b2b-855f-a3c7b88dc9f7
