ProjectStir [Pre-Alpha] is a meticulously crafted driving simulation application designed to assess driving skills through a game-centric approach. My contributions include serving as the project lead, where I prioritized and coordinated tasks, and also acting as the game designer.

<p>
Hopeless is a side-scrolling game that combines the mechanics of Cat Mario with the art style of Limbo. I use this game as a teaching material to introduce basic game programming concepts using Unity. The core game mechanics can be developed in less than one day.
